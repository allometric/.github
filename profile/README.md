## allometric ðŸŒ²

Welcome to the organization page for `allometric`. We are creating a rigorously maintained database of allometric models used in forest resource monitoring.

This includes:

- The [`allometric`](https://github.com/allometric/allometric) R package, which is the main way people use allometric models in analysis
- The [`models`](https://github.com/allometric/models) repository, which is an open source, version-tracked repository of allometric models that anyone can contribute to
- The [`alloview`](https://github.com/allometric/alloview) web application, which displays allometric models in an easy-to-explore interface
